## Actions CI: Add MINGW64 builds using msys2 (0970175)

Add MINGW64 builds to CI workflow for Tesseract using MSYS2

This change introduces a new CI workflow file for MINGW64 builds alongside the existing MINGW32 configuration. The workflows automate the installation of dependencies and the building of Tesseract OCR tools on Windows using MSYS2.

### Changes
- Introduced `.github/workflows/msys2-4.1.1.yml` for MINGW64 builds.
- Updated existing `.github/workflows/msys2.yml` to include MINGW32 and MINGW64 configurations.
- Added steps to install dependencies and build Tesseract for both architectures.

### Impact
- The workflows now support building Tesseract for both MINGW32 and MINGW64, enhancing compatibility.
- No breaking changes, but the addition of a new CI file may affect CI runtime.
- Potentially improved build verification for different environments.

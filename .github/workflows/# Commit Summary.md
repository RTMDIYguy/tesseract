## top-skimming import from sf.net … (cd65104)

Initial import of Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine codebase from sf.net.

This commit introduces several essential files including the AUTHORS, COPYING, and README documents, along with build configuration files. The goal is to set the foundation for the open-source version of the Tesseract OCR Engine.

### Changes
- Added new files: `.cvsignore`, `AUTHORS`, `COPYING`, `ChangeLog`, `INSTALL`, `Makefile.am`, `Makefile.in`, `NEWS`, and `README`.
- Established initial project structure for Tesseract's build and documentation.

### Impact
- No immediate behavioral changes as this is an import; however, the project is now structured for building and distribution.
- Dependencies are not directly affected, but the inclusion of configuration files may require updates to build environments.
- There are no breaking changes as this is an initial setup.
- Performance implications are not apparent at this stage since no functional code has been modified or executed.
